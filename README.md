# ButtonGameCSharp
Button game, now in csharp!!

Button game was originally just a really bad game that you pushed some buttons and it had a secret cheat 'settings' menu; it was one of the worse things I have made, but now it serves as that, and a dll runner. This may sound very confusing, because thats not how it works. But, how it works is you put a dll in the same folder as the program and it makes a new window and injects the dll there. I know, weird; but this is for the weird people that speak bash or wtv and want to write their code to inject as a dll into an empty window.
